# pfsense-logstash-grafana

![ScreenShot](https://raw.github.com/kiokoman/pfsense-logstash-grafana/master/images/immagine.jpg)

tested under Ubuntu, pfSense 2.4.5-p1 and 2.5.0 (RFC 3164)

suricata in legacy mode, for inline i think you only need to change "action" under grafana from "wdrop" (would drop) to "drop" < need to be tested
